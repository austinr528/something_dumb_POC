- still a few gotcha pixes (DEVIN GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER) (not true anymore? 2/10/24)
- sliding animation (partly done 2/24/24)
- interfaces/inheritance
- Death blocks? (got a few 2/24/24)
- add some momentum, when we stop inputing a direction he should slide a bit more in the (this is pretty good as of 2/24/24)
  last direction especially if running
- Add low jump and high jump dependent on how long pressed
- running should have more ramp up time (time to full speed) (I still think this 2/24/24)
