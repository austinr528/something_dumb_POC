# TODO

- When jumping or falling player rotation should be none
- still a few gotcha pixes (DEVIN GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER) (not true anymore? 2/10/24)
- sliding animation
- interfaces/inheritance
- Death blocks?
- add some momentum, when we stop inputing a direction he should slide a bit more in the
  last direction especially if running
- fall even faster, the jump up is ok but the falling needs to happen quicker,
  the transition from 0 y velocity to X needs a bump
- Add low jump and high jump dependent on how long pressed
- running should have more ramp up time (time to full speed)
